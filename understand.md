# What it means
Use our knowledge and interaction with the user to make sure that we’re solving the right problem.

# How we do it
## Getting started
How do you turn ideas into action? Design isn’t an exact science. Think in terms of rules of thumb and general flow. Expect uncertainty and get started.

Here’s how:
- Plan how you’ll engage users
- Prepare the team for creative collaboration
- Assemble the team
- Set expectations
- Collect or create relevant materials
- Create a dedicated work space

## Bringing user information into design
Account execs, support staff, customer advisory boards, online communities, and existing research programs can give information about users. They can also help you reach out to contacts and users to participate as members of your design team. If you have access to a user experience team or resource, request advice on how to recruit users efficiently and effectively.

## Diverging and generating ideas—investigation mode
This stage of the approach is focused on understanding users and their goals and needs, and defining the design challenge.
- Listen  to users, distill  information, and define the project challenge and how to address it with a great user experience.
- Feel free to inquire, imagine, stare out the window, look for hidden patterns, and really drill in on what users want and need.
- Your users’ idea of a great solution may be quite different from yours. Pay attention. This is an opportunity for real innovation.

## The team
Teams and projects are unique, but there are common themes and tasks you should be aware of as you create your team. Equally important is making sure that all members are engaged collaboratively from the beginning of the project.
- **Product managers, program managers, and executive sponsors:** Responsible for the business case and general direction, guiding the team to decisions, reaching milestones, and keeping the project moving.
- **Technical or subject matter expert:** Knows and helps navigate the technical landscape. Keeps focus on realistic solutions but will push technical boundaries when necessary.
- **Interaction or user experience designer/strategist:** Conceives, visualizes, and communicates design ideas and proposals. Translates requirements and user needs into representations the team uses to drive toward a solution.
- **Technical writer, content strategist, and information architect:** Creates and structures information and contributes to design of product architecture. Produces content including UI text, online help, and documentation. Often the “front-line” UX representative on the project.
- **Visual designer:** Owns appearance and visual style. Works with and may extend design guidelines. Often will contribute to mockups and design layouts and workflows.
- **User researcher:** Gathers and integrates data from users, competitive analysis, support team, customer surveys, etc., to build understanding of user needs and expectations.
- **User:** A representative current or target user of the product. User partners in the design team drive user-centric focus with ideas, inspiration, and critical feedback.

## Your secret weapon: a technical writer
At Akamai, chances are good that a technical writer is embedded in your product team already, even when a full-blown UCD effort isn’t underway. Lean on your technical writer. Always use them to write or edit your UI text. They can point you to other helpful design and UX assistance too.

## Materials and setting
The design tools you should use are low-tech. Don’t waste time on overly polished, complicated mockups and prototypes. Keep these tips in mind:
- **Human-centered design is about human engagement.**
  - Engage and collaborate with your team. Co-location is best; video conferencing is acceptable. Establish a shared repository of product and design-related information and documents.
- **Low-tech materials are your friends.**
  - Whiteboards
  - Dry-erase markers
  - Paper flip charts
  - Sticky notes
  - Big pieces of paper
  - Sharpie markers
  - Tape
  - String
  - Construction paper
  - Any other low-tech tools that free your thinking and make the work participatory
- **Keep a record without disrupting the design process.**
  - Your phone is also a camera and voice and video recorder. Use it.
  - Capture stages of the work, false starts, crazy ideas, etc. This will help you track progress and might capture a useful idea that would otherwise be lost.
  - Your evaluation of ideas will change as you learn through design and prototyping. Keep a record so you can track progress and revisit ideas occasionally.
- **If possible, create a dedicated work space.** If you can’t, flip charts, easels, and mobile whiteboards can be moved easily from space to space.

## UX Research at Akamai
To design product experiences that drive the success of our customers, we must connect with them directly to understand who they are, their requirements, and their challenges.

## Planning research
Whether you’re doing interviews or engaging customers in a participatory design exercise, it’s important to plan research carefully. Here are some general timeframes to keep in mind:
- Recruiting participants: 2 weeks
- Running the study: 1-2 weeks
- Analyzing and synthesizing findings: 1 week

## Research information and contacts
The [Akamai Community](https://community.akamai.com/){:target="_blank"} and [existing research programs at Akamai](mailto:janderso@akamai.com) are good sources of secondary information about users. The UXD research team can also advise you on selecting, recruiting, and including users in your product design. You can contact [Jenn Anderson](mailto:janderso@akamai.com), UX Research Director, or [Paula Mason](mailto:pamason@akamai.com), UX Researcher and Recruiter, for additional guidance on research strategies and recruiting support.

## Tools and techniques
Your team’s expertise, design challenge, and schedule will influence which tools you use. Below are brief descriptions for many common techniques, and links to additional materials including templates and guidelines for their use.

## Interviewing customers
Interviews give qualitative and detailed info about whys and hows of people’s interactions. They can vary in structure and can be performed locally or remotely.

## Journey maps
Journey maps capture users’ engagement with the company, its people, systems, and products, across the business lifecycle. The journey map captures contact points, user emotions, thoughts, and interactions.

## Affinity mapping
Affinity mapping is a technique for organizing and identifying themes and groupings in sets of ideas and information.

## Empathy maps
Empathy maps provide a graphic representation of users’ thoughts, emotions, beliefs, and actions. They also summarize pain points and ideas for addressing them.

## Personas
Personas are primarily text descriptions of users and user types relevant to your project. Akamai has created standard user personas and also has a template you can follow if you need to modify or create personas.

## User stories
User stories are simple statements about what the user does with the product to achieve a specific outcome. A collection of user stories can be used as the functional specification for basic design of the product and its user interface and experience.

## Day in the life depiction
A Day in the Life depiction shows what a typical day looks like for the user: which activities the user engages in, what success and failure look like, stresses and pressures, and the pace and schedule of the day.

## Kano model
The Kano model prioritizes product features and attributes. It can be used to classify features into those that are basic or essential, those that will increase customer satisfaction linearly, those that will delight the customer and differentiate the product, and those that are non-essential and should be disregarded.

## Project brief
The project brief is a concise description of the project. It serves as an elevator pitch and summary of the project, its goals, the target user, the business needs, and any known implementation challenges and constraints.

# Moving forward
Working through the Understand stage gives insights to use in the Conceive stage. There is judgment involved in switching stages, and you may overlap them as you work. In general, you should be taking on Conceive activities when you have:
- A shared understanding of the user, business goals, and project constraints as captured in the project brief.
- Identified or created the core persona(s) relevant to your design.
- Represented what users think, say, do, and feel in the context of using the product, in an empathy map.
- Documented the key points in the user’s engagement with the product and their touchpoints and emotion, in a journey map.
- Prioritized features and functionality using a Kano model analysis.
Remember that this is a rough guideline. You may not require all of these artifacts for your project, and you may have information from other tools and sources. Move into the Conceive stage when you know and understand your users and how the product provides value to them and the business.
