# Why user-centered design matters
A user-centered design approach focuses on understanding user needs, wants, and perceptions.
- User-centered design maximizes the value of the product to the user and opens the door to creating an enduring partner relationship.
- Combining functional value and positive experience creates a competitive advantage for our customers. The customer’s success in turn becomes an enduring competitive advantage for Akamai.


# Being user-centric
User-centered design can be very non-linear. Maintain your focus by keeping a few questions in mind:

*Who are the  users, and how are we solving important problems for  them?*
- Make these questions core to your design approach, to deliver a product that meets the user’s needs.
- Have them in mind as you explore, propose solutions, innovate, and build. If you’re not building for the user, who are you building for?

*How might we?*
- Popularized by Tim Brown at IDEO, “How might we” pushes teams to explore possibilities and to maintain a solution focus.
- If you are blocked, discouraged, or feel that the pace of solution generation is grinding to a halt, give yourself the power to cause change by asking “How might we?”
