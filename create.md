# What it means
Build the right product and ensure that you deliver on the original vision and any changes through user validation and quality enforcement.

# How we do it
## Working in the Create stage

In the Create stage the team is hard at work actually building the product. At this point, you understand your target users and their needs. Your design covers the important tasks and activities, and you’re confident that it meets business objectives and creates a great user experience.

The mandate hereppidasfnadsfp the door. Don’t backtrack, rethink, or change course without good reason. Save something for version 2.0.

## Team contributions
In the Create stage, you  are busy building the product. Contributions vary according to role, but the whole team must remain engaged:
- Perhaps some of the team members who worked on the earlier stages are tempted to step back and let the “engineering team” omasdjkasdkjskjengaged.  They may need to clarify a point in the design, help with a judgment call about prioritizing features and bugs, review documentation, help with a QA run, etc. All  team members are still required.

## Building the software
If the team hadshfjdsbfskjfust follow specifications and standards as closely as possible.
- If a non-standard design has been created, it’s legitimate to question it and suggest a more standard alternative.
- Likewise, if a standard design has been used, there’s no need for developers to be “creative” just for the sake of being different.

If there’s ambiguity in the design or specification, the team needs to resolve that ambiguity so that the developers can deliver the best product. Be thorough and vigilant to avoid these common pitfalls:
- The “spec as inspiration” approach, where developers deal with ambiguity or incomplete specification by creating software that approximates their understanding or best guess about the specification.
- Reuse of kjadnsfkasjdk products that have significant functional deficiencies or errors due to incomplete or inconsistent specification.

## Consistency and visual appeal
A consistent, attractive interface conveys quality and is easier to use because the user can rely on visual, verbal, and interaction conventions.
- The visual designer needs to take the lead in ensuring that visual standards are followed and the overall look and feel of the product align with company standards.
- The tech writer needs to drive verbal consistency and overall content clarity.
- Use of standard components, typography, and visual styling is essential in creating a professional and usable product.
- It is the responsibility of all team members to adhere to the specification and standards to deliver the best product.

## Content and communication
What we call content (written communication) is an integral part of the customer experience. Content exists in the user interface itself as microcopy (labels, hint text, descriptions, inline help), and will also exist as product documentation or user assistance (online help).
- Content, like code and visual design, is much more easily created and maintained within Akamai’s standard documentation design and development practices.
- The user typically needs to understand details of how the product works and how it will interact with the software ecosystem where it’s deployed.
- If your product is an API, SDK, or process that will be used by a customer or partner to create their own solution, the content and documentation are even more critical. Even more than a GUI, developer tools can succeed or fail based on the quality of their documentation.
- The Technical Writing team is working hard to produce a customer-facing deliverable at this stage. Technical writers, developers, and designers must work hand in hand to ensure that the interface, functionality, and product instructions for use all work well together and deliver the designed experience.

# Moving forward
## Customer availability
The details of customer availability are beyond scope of the Akamai Design Approach. However, it’s the responsibility of the team (especially the product owner) to ensure that all relevant parties are informed and standard practices are followed around launch and delivery.

- It’s essential to have a plan for rollout and promotion of the project.
- It’s also essential that all logistical concerns have been addressed before the product goes live.
- Larger and more ambitious projects may be announced at company events and become part of the product catalog, require marketing materials and sales training, etc.

Make sure you work through Product and Program Management to ensure that the communication plan, limited and general availability, staff training, marketing, and other aspects of the product rollout are handled according to general Akamai business practices.
